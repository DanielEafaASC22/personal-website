            <img width = "600px" class="img1" src="images/soccer.jpeg">

        
            <p>Ever since his childhood, Daniel has always had a strong passion for the sport of soccer. Whether it was in school, at the park, or even in his backyard he would always be thinking about soccer in one way or another.</p>
            <h2><strong>How did he continue his career? </strong></h2>
            <p>Daniel's parents would never let him join a travel team, due to the price of each match. However, that did not stop him from playing recreation soccer locally. Every Fall and Spring, grades Kindergarten to 8th, Daniel would compete in a short league in his city. Although he always wanted to win the league, he stayed loyal to his team ran by his favorite coach, team Barca. They won one league title, back in Spring of 2014 when Daniel was still a 3rd grader.</p>
            <p>He was a prolific striker who would often score some great goals. Despite his lack of height at the time, he was not a force to be reckoned with. He even once scored 5 goals in one game, in a match that ended up 6-0 in favor of his team, team Barca. His best season ever was in Spring of 2014 when Daniel scored 10 goals in 8 games. That was also the same year he scored 5 in one game, and won the title. What a great year it was!</p>
            <h2>Did he continue in highschool?</h2>
            <p>As a freshmen in his school, Daniel was on the JV team. He was still smaller than most people he played against but he was still very technically gifted. However when he came back junior year with a huge growth spurt, he no longer had any setbacks. He was much faster, stronger, taller, and used his body more efficiently. </p>
